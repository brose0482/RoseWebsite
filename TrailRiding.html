            Trail riding is the most common riding in the state. Although there are many mountains and lakes that you can free ride on, most people choose to stick to the trails because it is much safer. New Hampshire offers hundreds of miles of public trails spanning across the entire state. The majority of these trails connect and have similar destinations.
            Pittsburg, Colebrook, Stewartstown, and Errol by far offer the most trails in the state, as they are areas with very low populations and a lot of open land to travel on. Pittsburg is seen as the snowmobiie capital of New England and has one of the largest snowmobile clubs in New Hampshire - The Pittsburg Ridge Runners. Snowmobile clubs are typically in charge of grooming and maintaining the trails in their area. 
            This means that before the season, they go out and prepare the trails, groom them when snow first falls, and maintains them throughout the winter and when there are storms.

            The map below shows all of the public trails in the state. The yellow represents primary trails, and the red represents corridor trails. The corridor trails are typically connection trails that bring a rider from one primary to another. 
            The map is designed to show the local trail systems, and does not account for a lot of the miles of trails in the state. However, these trail systems often lead to the trails not shown. The trails can also take you out of New Hampshire into Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and even Canada.

            Trail riding in New Hampshire is special for many reasons. The scenery, culture, and interconnected systems are the main three reasons. The scenery is truly unmatched. Having the ability to ride to the top of a mountain gives you an abundance of breathtaking views, where you can see for miles on end.
            Especially as the sun starts to set, the view of the sunset or the lights of a nearby town are an unbelievable sight to see. The culture of trail riding is also special. On these trails you will come across many people who you have never met and will probably never see again. However, they tend to be the most friendly and welcoming people.
            It is just a part of rural life in New Hampshire, and the snowmobile clubs and trail systems are often sponsored by local businesses too. Lastly, there is an interconnected system for trail riding. This is meaning that you can ride for hours upon end all over the state and into another within a day, it is truly special.
