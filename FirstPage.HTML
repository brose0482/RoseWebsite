            Snowmobiling is a fascinating winter hobby. There are hundreds of miles of groomed trails and many breathtaking views along those trails.
            New Hampshire is an unforgetable place to ride. You have the White Mountains, large lakes, and much more the further north you travel. Many people travel to the northern part of the state every weekend to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity!

            Spending a weekend in the northern part of the stae is very common for those who snowmobile. Many own their own camps or houses in this area, while others rent cabins or stay in hotels. This creates more attraction for some very small towns in New Hampshire that seem like ghost towns during the other three seasons.
            There is also opportunities to rent a snowmobile for a weekend for those who do not own their own. This hobby alone is have the state draws a lot of attraction, aside from leaf-peeping season.

            If considering traveling to New Hampshire to snowmobile, there are a few things to consider. The first thing is that on the trails, you will likely have little cell service. Not having an experienced rider with you could put you in a dangerous situation if you are not careful, as you may not be able to call for help. The weather is another thing to consider. Like most states in the northern region of the United States, temperatures can be brutal.
            It is very important to prepare for the cold, and understand that different places, like the Franconia Notch, the weather can be dramatically different because you are between two mountains. This means that the wind can be extreme and it can be signifcantly colder.
