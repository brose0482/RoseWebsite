            There are a few requirements needed to ride in New Hampshire. All riders are required to carry a registration for their snowmobile, whiich can be purchased through NH Fish & Game. Any rider under the age of 16 is also required to have a Snowmobile Safety Certificate in order to ride. Lastly, if riding off trail you must need landowner permission to do so.
            These requirements are for safety reasons, mainly to help you be identified. It is also similar to driving a vehicle as you need a standard drivers license to operate a snowmobile over the age of 16, and do not need the safety certificate.

            All riders under the age of 18 are required to wear a helmet when operating, for those over the age it is strongly encouraged. These helmets must be Department of Transportation (DOT) approved. Helmets are not required for those over the age of 18 for the same reason as riding a motorcycle. That reason is because the state motto is "Live Free or Die". Having several layers of warm clothing is also important for safety because of the cold conditions.
            Most people wear a base layer, as well sweatshirts, pants, snowpants, winter jacket, gloves, and typically some sort of head sock. This ensures you will stay warm and avoid conditions like hypothermia.

            Speed is another thing to pay attention to in order to ensure your safety. Most state trails have a posted speed limit. Typically no more than 35 mph. For new riders or someone riding an unfamiliar trail, riding slightly below the speed limit is recommended. 
            Speed is the #1 cause of accidents on snowmobiles. Many riders do not slow down for corners, intersections, and merges, ultimately leading to a high rate of accidents. One thing to remember when riding is that speed + icy trails = accidents.
